Senior Software Engineer,ZenRows, hace 1 semana ,"['Amazon Web Services (AWS)', 'Arquitectura', 'Arquitectura de soluciones', 'Español', 'Go', 'Ingeniería', 'Trabajo en remoto']","Acerca del empleoSenior Software Engineer (Remote - Based in Spain) 🇪🇸About UsZenRows is a rapidly growing startup. We work 100% remotely and have been developing a SaaS for massive data collection that includes the most complete Anti-Bot protection bypass system on the market. This is currently used by thousands of companies worldwide in diverse sectors like marketing, real estate, e-commerce, and finance. Founded by serial entrepreneurs Aurken and Ander, and after raising our first funding round last year (+€1.1M), ZenRows is made up of a small team of 10 people, and we are looking to expand our Software Engineering team. Who Are We Looking For?Proactive and responsible professionals: we hate micromanagement, perhaps as much as you do. We neither want nor can we be overseeing someone on a day-to-day basis. We need someone who isn't afraid to experiment, fail, or discuss with the rest of the team"". If you think something isn't done correctly, debate, pull-request, and go to production. If you believe something can add value, create a task in the kanban board and let's get to work.Eager to learn and experiment with new technologies constantly as we have an infinity of things to develop, and for that, we continuously incorporate new tools, programming languages, and services into our technology stack. You need to be passionate about this; if you find it difficult to adapt or prefer to stick to your main stack, it won't work.Self-taught and problem-solver: although the rest of the team will lend you a hand when needed, we need you to be able to tackle problems on your own. We want someone who encounters an error, identifies the root problem, and finds the solution. And if there's something new to face, you know exactly where to turn for training.A non-stack profile: knowing how to develop software and understanding how it is developed in a team is enough. Technologies change, and they are not too different from each other. But if you master the basics, you'll learn Go, PHP, or TypeScript in a few weeks without much issue.However, you'll score extra points if you have experience in some of the following technologies:Go, as it is our main programming language, and most of the software you'll contribute to on a daily basis is developed in this language.Amazon Web Services (AWS), since all our software runs 100% in the public cloud, and the vast majority, specifically on AWS. We use dozens of services like Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon ECS, AWS Fargate, Amazon ElastiCache, SNS, SQS, Lambda functions, etc.Containers, like all our software, run inside containers during most of their lifecycle (development, testing, and production). You have much to gain if you understand at least how they work!Git, since we use GitHub as version control, and even if you don't know the difference between a merge and a rebase yet, we need you to know what a commit, a pull request, a branch, etc., are.Terraform, as we treat 100% of our cloud-deployed infrastructure as code. The manifests to deploy from the first to the last service are in repos, and therefore, any infrastructure change that needs to be made must be developed this way.  What Do We Offer?Flexible working hours: we don't count the hours you're connected on Slack, nor do we care if you prefer to get up early or work late at night. We are responsible and organize our workdays as best suits us.100% remote work: some team members are on different continents and time zones. If we see each other in person, it will likely only be to celebrate. 🎉An incredible opportunity for professional growth: we have very high-level technological challenges, a generous budget, and a core team with much experience. There's no time to get bored: every week, we learn a million new things together and improve what we already knew how to do. Professional growth ad infinitum.Technical and language training: part of our team doesn't speak Spanish, making us a team that communicates (primarily) in English. If you need classes to reinforce your level or want to do any technical course/training, just say it!Whatever you need to do your job: do you prefer a MacBook over an HP laptop? Do you need a software license for your favorite IDE? GitHub Copilot? Just ask for it.A flat organization: the CEO is good-natured and is on Slack, just like the rest. If you need something, write to him. No bureaucracy, no nonsense. Your voice will be constantly heard.  What Can You Expect?We have grown frantically in recent months, and sustaining the growth of such a dynamic startup with such a small engineering team means that your incorporation will probably not be conventional:  What you will findSome of the most significant technological challenges in the national scene. Our backend is not a REST API that performs CRUD operations against a database. At ZenRows, we develop software with which we orchestrate thousands of CPU cores, hundreds of gigabytes of memory, manage millions of daily requests, and have outgoing network traffic of hundreds of terabytes per month, simulate human behavior to not be detected by antibot services developed by companies with thousands of engineers and billions of dollars in budget… and much more. What we develop is out of the ordinary.A truly multidisciplinary team. No tricks. We are a small team, and that generally implies that in your day-to-day, you will end up touching (and learning!) a lot of different technologies in a lot of different projects: one day, you might be programming in Go, then a script in bash, touching infrastructure in AWS or GCP, lending a hand to the Growth team with the CMS, contributing to public documentation in Markdown, or exposing a REST endpoint for a Laravel to consume. We just need you not to be afraid. No one will blame you if you need to learn the syntax when switching technologies, introduce bugs, or it's the first time you've seen something similar. When the team grows, silos will start to separate, but for now…Autonomy. Once the onboarding finishes, we expect you to be able to start thinking and prioritizing autonomously. Although the company's roadmap is always present, day-to-day tasks are not marked. Most of the time, you will decide what you will focus on and what you think adds value.No-blame culture. Whoever touches stuff breaks stuff. We deploy to production many times daily, and sometimes we mess up. Rollback, we learn from mistakes and deploy again. We are adults, we don't throw anyone under the bus when things don't go well. We are a team and prefer to find a way to prevent a problem from repeating rather than wasting time looking for the culprit. What you will not findA ton of documentation on the projects. As the team grows, so does the documentation. For now, you won't find many updated architecture diagrams or a Notion with a thousand hours of reading. We expect you to be able to dive into the code little by little, understanding and asking everything you need.A coverage of unit tests of 90%. Not even 80%. Not even 60%. We develop tests for the parts we know can explode at any moment, but we prefer to err on the side of leaving things untested rather than delaying the features that support the business. We are quite pragmatic and optimize our time / effort as much as possible.Agile, Scrum, Lean... or whatever development methodology is trendy this week. You'll have a rather horizontal view of technology and will be able to identify where you think you can contribute the most. However, we don't work in sprints, nor is there a man in a tie to whom you need to justify each morning why something is taking longer than predicted to deploy. We have a backlog and a three-column Kanban board: that's it.A comfortable job. We are an early-stage startup, day-to-day is not comfortable. We have fun, we love what we do, but we work hard and commit. If there is a fire, everyone pitches in. If you are looking to work in pyjamas from home from 9:00h to 15:00h… this is not the place. P.S.: You can work in pyjamas if you like :P", España ,Jornada completa,En remoto, 23 solicitudes,2024-01-25,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3805479128&keywords=Data%20Scientist&origin=JOB_SEARCH_PAGE_JOB_FILTER&refresh=true&sortBy=R&start=750#HYM,linkedin
